# Naruto-Mod
THIS BRANCH HAS BEEN MADE TO START THE FABRIC RECODE

ote: The package SekCore is used betwen a few of my projects (mostly unreleased) and if it ever has enough features it will become its own library.


The mod adds various features to minecraft such as items, mobs, weapons, new player animations and chakra. The mod is still in beta so there are a lot of features still being added.

The mod is still in beta so a lot is still being changed and added.

All code here is not what is exactly what I currently have made and when code is pushed to here it may generally be in large edits.

If you would like to contribute to the language files by creating another language or editing one of the current files fork the repo and make any changes or additions to the language files you feel are neccasary. The language files can be found [here](https://github.com/sekwah41/Naruto-Mod/tree/master/src/main/resources/assets/narutomod/lang).
